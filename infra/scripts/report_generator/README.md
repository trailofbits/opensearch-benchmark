## Usage

1. Follow the [Python quickstart guide for the Google Workspace API](https://developers.google.com/docs/api/quickstart/python). Make sure to enable Google Docs/Spreadsheet access in the scopes.
2. Run `poetry install`
3. Download the benchmark files in .csv format in a common folder. Naming scheme should be: `es-<workload_name>.csv`, `os-<workload_name>.csv`
4. Pass the folder to the report generator: `poetry run report_generator --token token.json --benchmark-data data` 

The first time that you run the tool, you will not have the token.json file. To generate it, pass in the credentials file you have generated by following the quickstart guide:

```
poetry run report_generator --credentials credentials.json --token token.json --benchmark-data data
```
